# Java EE POS System

## Introduction

The Java EE POS System is a versatile backend solution designed to handle Point of Sale (POS) operations. This system provides robust functionalities for managing orders, customers, and inventory, leveraging Java EE technologies, JNDI for database connections, and MySQL for data storage.

## Key Features

- *Order Management*: Ability to create and retrieve orders.
- *Customer Management*: Full CRUD operations for customer records—create, read, update, and delete.
- *Item Management*: Full CRUD operations for inventory items—create, read, update, and delete.

## Technologies Used

- *Java EE*: Backend development using servlets and Java Beans.
- *Jakarta JSON Binding (JSON-B)*: For handling JSON data.
- *JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface)*: Manages database connections.
- *MySQL*: Provides relational database management.
- *SLF4J*: Used for logging purposes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK 11 or higher
- Apache Tomcat (or another compatible servlet container)
- MySQL database and JDBC driver

### Installation Steps

1. *Clone the Repository:*

    bash
    git clone[ https://github.com/your-repo/javaee-pos-system.git](https://github.com/mueenamueen/POS-JavaEE)
    cd javaee-pos-system
    

2. *Database Configuration:*

   - *MySQL Setup*: Ensure MySQL is installed and create a database for the POS system.
   - *JNDI Configuration*: Update your servlet container’s configuration to include a DataSource resource for MySQL.

     Example JNDI configuration for Tomcat:
     xml
     <Resource name="jdbc/posSystem" auth="Container" type="javax.sql.DataSource"
               maxActive="100" maxIdle="30" maxWait="10000"
               username="your_db_username" password="your_db_password"
               driverClassName="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"
               url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_db_name"/>
     

3. *Build and Deploy:*

   - With Maven:
     bash
     mvn clean install
     
   - Deploy the WAR file to your servlet container (e.g., Tomcat).

4. *Start the Server:*

   Launch your servlet container and deploy the application.

## API Documentation

The API provides endpoints to manage orders, customers, and items. For detailed information on how to use the API, including request and response formats, please consult the [API Documentation]([https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/35384500/2sA3s3GWG7](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/35384500/2sA3s3GWG7#intro)).

## JNDI Configuration

This project uses JNDI for abstracting database connection details. The connection details are managed outside the application code, making it more flexible and easier to manage.

- *JNDI Resource Lookup*: Database connections are handled via JNDI lookup, configured in the servlet container (e.g., Tomcat).

## MySQL Database

- *Database Setup*: Ensure MySQL is installed and set up a database schema suitable for the POS system, including tables for customers, items, and orders.

## Logging

Logging is implemented with SLF4J. You can view logs in the server logs and adjust logging settings as needed.
